#Write a function named isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary
#argument and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.
#A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. 
#Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all 
#pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t 
#be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent 
#white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. 
#This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
